So, we'll need sounds for the fireball, heal, stun, and bulwark (probably a shield sound) abilities. I don't think we'll need separate classes for any of the other abilities, but if we do they'll all go here. More than likely we'll only need one sound for the basic attacks of both the knight and thief, and we can just reuse that sound for the multi-attack the knight has. The thief's stealth shouldn't need an effect.
